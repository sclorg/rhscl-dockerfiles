Ruby Docker image
=================

This repository contains the source for building various versions of
the Ruby application as a reproducible Docker image using
[source-to-image](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image).
Users can choose between RHEL and CentOS based builder images.
The resulting image can be run using [Docker](http://docker.io).


Usage
---------------------
To build a simple [ruby-sample-app](https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby/tree/master/2.2/test/puma-test-app) application
using standalone [S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) and then run the
resulting image with [Docker](http://docker.io) execute:

*  **For RHEL based image**
    ```
    $ s2i build https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby.git --context-dir=2.2/test/puma-test-app/ rhscl/ruby-23-rhel7 ruby-sample-app
    $ docker run -p 8080:8080 ruby-sample-app
    ```

*  **For CentOS based image**
    ```
    $ s2i build https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby.git --context-dir=2.2/test/puma-test-app/ centos/ruby-23-centos7 ruby-sample-app
    $ docker run -p 8080:8080 ruby-sample-app
    ```

**Accessing the application:**
```
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080
```


Repository organization
------------------------
* **`<ruby-version>`**

    * **Dockerfile**

        CentOS based Dockerfile.

    * **Dockerfile.rhel7**

        RHEL based Dockerfile. In order to perform build or test actions on this
        Dockerfile you need to run the action on a properly subscribed RHEL machine.

    * **`s2i/bin/`**

        This folder contains scripts that are run by [S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image):

        *   **assemble**

            Used to install the sources into the location where the application
            will be run and prepare the application for deployment (eg. installing
            modules using bundler, etc.)

        *   **run**

            This script is responsible for running the application by using the
            application web server.

        *   **usage***

            This script prints the usage of this image.

    * **`contrib/`**

        This folder contains a file with commonly used modules.

    * **`test/`**

        This folder contains a [S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image)
        test framework with a simple Rack server.

        * **`puma-test-app/`**

            Simple Puma web server used for testing purposes by the [S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) test framework.

        * **`rack-test-app/`**

            Simple Rack web server used for testing purposes by the [S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) test framework.

        * **run**

            Script that runs the [S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) test framework.


Environment variables
---------------------

To set these environment variables, you can place them as a key value pair into a `.sti/environment`
file inside your source code repository.

* **RACK_ENV**

    This variable specifies the environment where the Ruby application will be deployed (unless overwritten) - `production`, `development`, `test`.
    Each level has different behaviors in terms of logging verbosity, error pages, ruby gem installation, etc.

    **Note**: Application assets will be compiled only if the `RACK_ENV` is set to `production`

* **DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION**

    This variable set to `true` indicates that the asset compilation process will be skipped. Since this only takes place
    when the application is run in the `production` environment, it should only be used when assets are already compiled.

Hot deploy
---------------------
In order to dynamically pick up changes made in your application source code, you need to make following steps:

*  **For Ruby on Rails applications**

    Run the built Rails image with the `RAILS_ENV=development` environment variable passed to the [Docker](http://docker.io) `-e` run flag:
    ```
    $ docker run -e RAILS_ENV=development -p 8080:8080 rails-app
    ```
*  **For other types of Ruby applications (Sinatra, Padrino, etc.)**

    Your application needs to be built with one of gems that reloads the server every time changes in source code are done inside the running container. Those gems are:
    * [Shotgun](https://github.com/rtomayko/shotgun)
    * [Rerun](https://github.com/alexch/rerun)
    * [Rack-livereload](https://github.com/johnbintz/rack-livereload)

    Please note that in order to be able to run your application in development mode, you need to modify the [S2I run script](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image#anatomy-of-a-builder-image), so the web server is launched by the chosen gem, which checks for changes in the source code.

    After you built your application image with your version of [S2I run script](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image#anatomy-of-a-builder-image), run the image with the RACK_ENV=development environment variable passed to the [Docker](http://docker.io) -e run flag:
    ```
    $ docker run -e RACK_ENV=development -p 8080:8080 sinatra-app
    ```

To change your source code in running container, use Docker's [exec](http://docker.io) command:
```
docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> /bin/bash
```

After you [Docker exec](http://docker.io) into the running container, your current
directory is set to `/opt/app-root/src`, where the source code is located.
